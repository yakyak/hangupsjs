## Summary

Client library for Google Hangouts in nodejs.

## Disclaimer

This library is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Google. Use
at your own risk.

## Origins

Port of https://github.com/tdryer/hangups to node js.

I take no credit for the excellent work of Tom Dryer putting together
the original python client library for Google Hangouts. This port is
simply taking his work and porting it to coffeescript step by step.

The library is rather new and needs more tests, error handling etc.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install hangupsjs
```

The client is started with `connect()` passing callback function for a
promise for a login object containing the credentials.

Example usage (javascript below):

```coffee
Client = require 'hangupsjs'
Q      = require 'q'

# callback to get promise for creds using stdin. this in turn
# means the user must fire up their browser and get the
# requested token.
creds = -> auth:Client.authStdin

client = new Client()

# set more verbose logging
client.loglevel 'debug'

# receive chat message events
client.on 'chat_message', (ev) ->
    console.log ev

# connect and post a message.
# the id is a conversation id.
client.connect(creds).then ->
    client.sendchatmessage('UgzJilj2Tg_oqkAaABAQ', [
        [0, 'Hello World']
    ])
.done()
```

The same example code in javascript:

```javascript
var Client = require('hangupsjs');
var Q = require('q');

// callback to get promise for creds using stdin. this in turn
// means the user must fire up their browser and get the
// requested token.
var creds = function() {
  return {
    auth: Client.authStdin
  };
};

var client = new Client();

// set more verbose logging
client.loglevel('debug');

// receive chat message events
client.on('chat_message', function(ev) {
  return console.log(ev);
});

// connect and post a message.
// the id is a conversation id.
client.connect(creds).then(function() {
    return client.sendchatmessage('UgzJilj2Tg_oqkAaABAQ',
    [[0, 'Hello World']]);
}).done();
```

## API

### High Level API

High level API calls that are not doing direct hangouts calls.

#### `Client()`

`Client(opts)`

`opts.cookiespath` (optional) path to file in which to store cached
login cookies. Defaults to `cookies.json` in module dir.

`opts.rtokenpath` (optional) path to file in which to store the
oauth refresh token. Defaults to `refreshtoken.txt` in module dir.

#### `connect`

`connect: (creds) ->`

Attempts to connect the client to hangouts. See
[`isInited`](#isinited) for the steps that connects the client.
Returns a promise for connection. The promise only resolves when init
is completed. On the [`connected`](#connected) event.

`creds`: is callback that returns a promise for login creds. The creds
are either `{creds:-><promise for token>}` or
`{cookies:<array of strings or tough-cookie-jar>}`

##### email/pass

To login using an email/password combo, you need to login using OAuth
and provide the access token to the API. Furthermore it uses a google
white listed OAuth CLIENT\_ID and CLIENT\_SECRET that shows up as
"iOS Device" in your accounts page.

This is the login URL, also available as `Client.OAUTH2_LOGIN_URL`.

https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?&client_id=936475272427.apps.googleusercontent.com&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Faccounts%2FOAuthLogin&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code

The library provides a stdin-method that requests the token.

```coffee
creds = -> auth:Client.authStdin

client.connect(creds).then -> # and so on...
```

##### cookies

The other way to log in is to provide a string array of cookies for
the `google.com` domain that are set up as part of a successful login.

Typically these cookies are called: `NID`, `SID`, `HSID`, `SSID`,
`APISID`, `SAPISID`

Example:

```coffee
creds = -> Q {cookies:[
    'NID=67=QI6go9WM<redacted>WDFxv; Expires=Wed, 04 Nov 2015 06:10:24 GMT; Domain=google.com; Path=/; HttpOnly'
    'SID=DASDPgAAA<redacted>AKJASKJD; Expires=Thu, 04 May 2017 06:10:24 GMT; Domain=google.com; Path=/'
    'HSID=AR<redacted>QX_; Expires=Thu, 04 May 2017 06:10:24 GMT; Domain=google.com; Path=/; HttpOnly; Priority=HIGH'
    'SSID=Ak<redacted>D; Expires=Thu, 04 May 2017 06:10:24 GMT; Domain=google.com; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly; Priority=HIGH'
    'APISID=kM<redacted>seXb; Expires=Thu, 04 May 2017 06:10:24 GMT; Domain=google.com; Path=/; Priority=HIGH'
    'SAPISID=cl<redacted>Od; Expires=Thu, 04 May 2017 06:10:24 GMT; Domain=google.com; Path=/; Secure; Priority=HIGH'
    ]}

client.connect(creds).then -> # and so on...
```


#### `disconnect`

`disconnect: ->`

Disconnects the client.


#### `isInited`

`isInited`

For Client to be fully inited the following must happen on
[`connect`](#connect)

1. Get login cookies against https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin
   or reuse cached cookies.

2. Using the cookies, fetch a PVT token (whatever that is) against
   https://talkgadget.google.com/talkgadget/_/extension-start

3. Load the chat widget HTML + javascript using the PVT token from
   https://talkgadget.google.com/u/0/talkgadget/_/chat

4. From the returned javascript get an `apikey` and some other headers
   used in each api call later.

5. Fetch channel `sid`/`gsid` from
   https://0.client-channel.google.com/client-channel/channel-bind

6. Using the `sid`/`gsid` open a long poll request against the same
   URL as in 5. This is the push data channel.

7. From first data coming through the push data channel, extract a
   `clientid` which also is used in each api call later.

8. Post a subscribe request against same URL as in 5 to make push data
   channel receive chat events.

Only after all these steps are completed will `isInited` return true.



#### `loglevel`

`loglevel: (level) ->`

Sets the log level one of `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`.


#### `logout`

`logout: () ->`

Logs the current client out by removing refresh token and cached cookies.

Example:

```coffee
# force cleared state
client.logout().then ->
    # will now require new credentials
    client.connect(creds)
.then ->
    ...
```

#### `MessageBuilder`

Helper to compose message `segments` that goes into
[`sendchatmessage`](#sendchatmessage). The builder has these methods.

Example:

```coffee
bld = new Client.MessageBuilder()
segments = bld.text('Hello ').bold('World').text('!!!').toSegments()
client.sendchatmessage('UgzfaJwj2Tg_oqk5EhEp5faABAQ', segments)
```

##### `builder.text(txt)`

`(txt, bold=false, italic=false, strikethrough=false, underline=false, href=null) ->`

Adds a text segment.

```coffee
builder.text('Hello')
```

##### `builder.bold(txt)`

Adds a text segment in bold.

##### `builder.italic(txt)`

Adds a text segment in italic.

##### `builder.strikethrough(txt)`

Adds a text segment strikethroughed.

##### `builder.underline(txt)`

Adds an underlined text segment.

##### `build.linebreak()`

Adds a new line.

##### `builder.link(txt, href)`

Adds a text that is a link.

##### `builder.toSegments`

Turns the builder into an array of segments usable for `sendchatmessage`.
